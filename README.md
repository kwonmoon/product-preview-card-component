## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS

### What I learned

- I decided to use sass to build this project. It was my first time trying sass. I might have made some mistakes in my sass, nonethless the outcome looks great.

### Continued development

- From now on, I think I am going to use sass.

### Useful resources

- [Sass and BEM for biginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfMHA8SqUL4) - This helped me to learn sass quickly. Her demo for building a project with sass looks great. It's not like toy tutorials. I got working knowledge by watching her Youtube.
